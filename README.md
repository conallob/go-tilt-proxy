# Overview

A small, lightweight proxy between [Tilt Hydrometers](https://tilthydrometer.com/) and various Cloud endpoints.


Unlike a pre-made Raspberry Pi SD Card image such as [TiltPi](https://github.com/baronbrew/TILTpi), or a dedicated hardware bridge such as [Tilt Bridge](https://github.com/thorrak/tiltbridge), go-tilt-bridge is intended to be easily installed onto any Linux installation, e.g a Raspberry Pi running Raspberry Pi OS

## Features

* Cloud Endpoints:
   * [Brewfather](http://www.brewfather.app)
   * Custom Endpoints
